# Final Project

## De-Mystifying ML

Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing and use Machine Learning in the context of the technologies we have learned.  The topic does NOT need to be a work of jaw-dropping divine inspiration.  Keep it simple!  It's perfectly fine to go through the paces tackling _basic_ problems of ML and practice your skills using the tools of the trade.  There are plenty of sites and topics that suggest good projects for beginners.  I would rather see you demonstrate proficiency with something small-scale than fall apart while shooting for the moon.  We would rather hear a pianist play Beethoven's "Für Elise" competently than hear one fumble through the savage difficulty of a Listz piano concerto.  This is simply **a project** focused on Machine Learning: it is _not_ the end-all-be-all capstone of all that we've learned since the beginning of class.  Keep it as simple as possible: Machine Learning is hard enough as it is.


## Requirements

- A single Git repository for each group (provided): you will be graded on the contents of the `master` branch.
- Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library.

### Possible Formats

- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau Notebook
- R Notebook
- Python Driven Website (e.g. Flask)

In addition, you must use at least two of the below:

    Python Pandas
    Python Matplotlib
    Python Tweepy
    Python Flask
    HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
    JavaScript Plotly
    Javascript D3.js
    JavaScript Leaflet
    MySQL or other relational Database
    MongoDB or other document Database
    Google Cloud SQL
    Amazon AWS
    Tableau


Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning in the context of what we’ve learned.


## Contributions

Each member must make contributions to the project!  I'll look for commits in Git, I'll listen to the feedback of group members, and I'll listen for you to speak up during the final presentation.

If your project uses a format other than a Python website, each member must submit their own
separate file that represents their work!


## Example Projects:

- Create a Front-End Interface that Maps to an API to “Smarten” the Algorithm
- Perform a Deep Dive of Existing Data Using Machine Learning
- Create a Visualization that Continues to “Learn” Where Clusters Lie Based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to Change the Visualization)
- Create an idea with “mock data” that simulates how machine learning might be used
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression

The key is to show the value of what you know.


## Grading

Your project will be graded on:

- Functionality (stuff should work).  You will be graded on the contents of the `master` branch.
- Following the guidelines: you must make use of the required technologies
- Each member's contributions
- Mastery of the skills
- Participation Survey by group members (to help identify non-tangible contributions)
- Class Feedback Survey (clickable survey)

I will have final say on the grade, but those are the areas that I will be considering.
